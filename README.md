# Shipping Label Maker

Shipping Label Maker is an application that collects shipping information from the user and prints a shipping label.

## Notes

The onAction function was modified to accept an action, action type, as well as a value to be given to the dispatch function rather than only having the action as the parameter. 

The onComplete was also modified to accept the newly built shipping information object.
